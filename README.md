 # 1.⚡ EDA on EV Charging Station 📊

Welcome to the **EDA on EV Charging Station** project, part of my **Data Analysis** repository. This project explores the characteristics, usage patterns, and geographical distribution of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations using Python and popular data analysis libraries.

## 🧠 Objective

The primary objective is to uncover insights from a dataset of EV charging stations through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This includes understanding:
- Distribution of charger types
- Parking availability
- Usage statistics (average users/day)
- Geographical distribution
- Other key station attributes

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains features such as:
- `station_id`
- `latitude`, `longitude`
- `charger_type`
- `connector_types`
- `parking_spots`
- `usage_stats_(avg_users/day)`
- `cost_(USD/kWh)`
- `charging_capacity_(kW)`
- `distance_to_city_(km)`
- `reviews_(rating)`
- `installation_year`

*Note: Some features may have been cleaned or renamed for better usability.*
